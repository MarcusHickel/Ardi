UTS rocketry Software course review 
00-blink
Lol my malware detection didnâ€™t like me running pio test.
Every test failed but im guessing cause im not running it on the same hardware from the Avionics workshop
Ngl never have I ever so so much trouble getting a blink script to run but ok.
Ok so a ran the test and somehow to buzzer was the only successful one (no buzzer is connected, and yes even flash failed)
Ok im going to pause here. I think having the wrong hardware is fucking everything up.
This might be redunant for software people but maybe a tutorial for using platformIO
Explain how the test scripts where made?
